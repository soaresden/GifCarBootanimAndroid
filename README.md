GIF : 

    Just Drag and Drop your gif file on the a-DroponMe.py  file
    
        then select:
        
        1 - To have a bootanimation.zip with a Endless Animation (like your gif)
        
        2 - To have a bootanimation.zip with a one loop animation and it stays at the last frame of your gif
        
        3 - Utility to convert your original gif file to an other size (it keep the original ratio and just add black background)
        Then you can use that resized gif to make again either option 1 or 2 of your choice.

ZIP :

    Just drag and drop your bootanimation on the a-DroponMe.py file

    it will detect automatically the framerate
    
        press enter if you want to stay original
        
        or try a different framerate
    
    then you will get a gif file again to work on
